With component architecture, it's an important to design components to contain what we call inputs and outputs. The data enters a component via an input, and leaves the component through an output. This is a small but powerful conceptual change to Angular 1.x's two-way data-binding in which changes automatically propagate to all listeners for that particular binding. Angular 1.x introduced one-way data-flow in the Angular 1.5.x branch, to which mirrors the Angular 2 way of building components. For this guide, we'll be using Angular 1.x's `.component()` method to compare to Angular 2.
